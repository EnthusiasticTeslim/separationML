## Reinforcement learning 
In this work, the reinforcement learning (RL) framework considered the following concepts:
- Agent: The learner or decision-maker.
- Environment: Everything the agent interacts with.
- State: A specific situation in which the agent finds itself.
- Action: All possible moves the agent can make.
- Reward: Feedback from the environment based on the action taken.


### Environment 
A simulation model of the electrodialysis system that can predict the next state given the current state and action. This is a physics-based model such that action (i.e. change in N, V, T_tot) results in C_out which is then used to compute the reward. 


### Reward 
Here, the reward is defined as one such that the separation efficiency is maximized to reach 100% while minimizing the energy consumed. Presently, the Desalination efficiency is selected as the reward function as it directly relates to the primary goal of the electrodialysis system. We define it as:
    `R = (C_in - C_out) / C_in`
Where:

    a) R is the reward (desalination efficiency)
    b) C_in is the input concentration of ions
    c) C_out is the output concentration of ions

This reward function will encourage the RL agent to maximize the removal of ions from the solution. 
* Possible improvement: I will consider incorporating energy efficiency into the reward function as well, to balance desalination performance with energy consumption. 
* For example: `R = α * ((C_in - C_out) / C_in) - β * (Energy_consumed / Volume_treated)` where α and β are weighting factors you can adjust to prioritize desalination efficiency vs. energy efficiency.

### Action Space 
Here, there are many parameters considered as what the agent mov

    a) N: Number of cell pairs (discrete)

    Range: Typically 1 to 80

    b) V: Applied voltage (continuous)

    Range: 0.2 to 2.0 volts

    c) T_tot: Total operation time (continuous)

    Range: 0 to 180 min.


### State

Same as the action


### Algorithm
Choose an algorithm (from `from stable_baseline3 import PPO`) that can handle mixed discrete-continuous action spaces. Options include:
- Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with modifications for discrete actions
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a mixed action distribution



### Training Process:
The RL agent would interact with the environment (simulated electrodialysis system) by:
- Observing the current state
- Choosing actions (N, V, T_tot)
- Receiving a reward based on the system's performance
- Updating its policy to maximize long-term rewards


### Strategies
The implementation steps are as follows:
- [] Develop a accurate simulation model of the electrodialysis system
- [] Define the RL components (state space, action space, reward function)
- [] Implement the chosen RL algorithm
- [] Train the agent on the simulated environment
- [] Validate the learned policy on unseen scenarios
- [] Carefully test on the real system, starting with a limited operational range
